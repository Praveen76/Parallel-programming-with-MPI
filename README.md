# Parallel Programming with MPI

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of standard message-passing algorithms using MPI (Message Passing Interface). It aims to help you understand the basics of point-to-point communication, blocking and non-blocking communication, and collective communication, along with their impact on program performance.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this experiment, you will be able to:

- Implement standard message-passing algorithms in MPI
- Debug simple MPI code
- Understand the basics of point-to-point communication
- Understand the difference between blocking and non-blocking communication
- Understand how non-blocking communication can improve program performance
- Understand the basics of collective communication
- Learn about the different types of collective communication

## Files

- **Parallel_Programming_with_MPI.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code and explanations for parallel programming using MPI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- `mpi4py` package (MPI for Python)

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```sh
pip install notebook mpi4py
```

Additionally, you need to have MPI installed on your system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install `mpich` or `openmpi` using:

```sh
sudo apt-get install mpich
# or
sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi-dev
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Parallel-programming-with-MPI.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```sh
cd Parallel-programming-with-MPI
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `Parallel_Programming_with_MPI.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to explore the concepts of parallel programming using MPI.
